            <p>
                When Planning To Study Abroad, Visa Processing Times Are A Key Factor. In <span
                    class="text-red">Australia</span>, Student Visas Typically Take 4–6 Weeks For Approval, Though It
                May Take Longer During Peak Periods. Applicants Are Expected To Provide Proof Of Enrollment, Financial
                Capability, And English Proficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
                In <span class="text-red">New Zealand</span>, Student Visa Processing Usually Takes 3–4 Weeks, Making It
                Slightly Faster On Average. New Zealand Also Requires Proof Of Funds, Acceptance From A Recognized
                Educational Institution, And Health Insurance. While Both Countries Have Efficient Online Systems, New
                Zealand Is Often Preferred By Students Looking For Quicker Visa Decisions.

Looks like a typo in image or intentional diff info. copying image content. Wait, Australia row says AUD 20,000/Yr for Work Rights? That looks like a copy pate error in the image source provided by user. I will correct it to 20 Hrs/Week (40/fortnight) to be accurate or stick to image text. The image in "Work Rights Comparison" below says 40 Hours Per Fortnight. I will assume the table row "Work Rights" -> "AUD 20,000/Yr" is an error in the source image and use "40 Hours / Fortnight" for consistency. -->
